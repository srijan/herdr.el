;;; Commentary:

;; Drive herdr (https://herdr.dev), a terminal workspace manager for AI
;; coding agents, from Emacs.
;;
;; herdr's terminals live inside Emacs via ghostel, so there is no
;; second terminal application in the loop.  Commands go over herdr's
;; unix socket; a live event stream keeps a cache of the session, which
;; feeds the modeline segment, the `*herdr-agents*' buffer, and the
;; completion pickers.
;;
;; Start with `M-x herdr'.
