;;; Commentary:

;; The escape hatch.  `herdr-cmd' covers the methods worth a keybinding;
;; this reaches the other sixty-odd without anyone writing a wrapper for
;; them, by prompting from the server's own schema.
;;
;; That is why the schema is loaded at runtime instead of generating 89
;; generated menu entries: full coverage without a menu nobody can read.
