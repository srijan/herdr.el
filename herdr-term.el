;;; Commentary:

;; herdr's terminals are hosted inside Emacs, never outside it.  There
;; are two ways to do that and this file implements both behind one
;; interface, because everything else in the package is indifferent to
;; the choice.
;;
;; `session' runs the herdr TUI in a single ghostel buffer.  herdr owns
;; the layout, plain shell panes work, and it is about sixty lines.
;;
;; `agent-windows' runs one ghostel buffer per agent, each holding a
;; `herdr agent attach'.  Emacs owns the layout and herdr's own layout
;; tree goes unused, so there is no geometry to synchronise.  Agents
;; outlive Emacs because the server is a daemon.
;;
;; Measurements that informed this, taken against herdr 0.7.5:
;;
;; - Throughput is not a reason to prefer either.  A 12.2 MB pane dump
;;   reached Emacs as 17 KB under `session' and 24 KB under
;;   `agent-windows'; herdr's VT only emits visible-frame diffs, so it
;;   rate-limits by construction.
;; - `agent attach' refuses a pane with no detected agent, which is why
;;   reconciliation considers agents rather than panes.
;; - Attachment is exclusive per pane, so a second attach needs
;;   `--takeover'.  We ask first rather than stealing.
;; - The client paints nothing into a zero-sized PTY.  ghostel sizes its
;;   terminal from the displayed window, so buffers are displayed before
;;   the process starts.
