;;; Commentary:

;; The command surface.  Every prefix shows which pane it is about to
;; act on, taken from the cache rather than asked for, so the common
;; case costs no prompting.  A prefix argument on any command retargets
;; through the picker instead.

;; top-level require here would be circular.

;; `herdr-agents' lives in herdr-dispatch.  Autoloaded rather than
;; required so this file does not drag in magit-section, and so the two
;; never form a load cycle once the dispatcher gains its own menu.

  "Return non-nil when herdr's own layout is on screen.

Tabs are a grouping inside a workspace whose only visual form is the
TUI's tab bar.  Under `agent-windows\=' Emacs owns the layout, so nothing
renders a tab: renaming one changes nothing observable, focusing one is
a roundabout way to reach a pane that `p\=' reaches directly, and closing
one is a confusing way to destroy panes you would close individually.
The whole tab surface is hidden there rather than half of it, which was
worse than either — `herdr-call\=' still reaches the methods.

Workspaces are not filtered: they are keyed by cwd, persist across
restarts, group the agents buffer, and back `herdr-project\=' — they are
herdr's per-project unit, not TUI furniture."

Key scheme, applied throughout: a lowercase noun jumps to that kind of
thing, the same letter uppercased opens its menu.  Verbs are consistent
across every menu — c create, f focus, r read, R rename, k close or
remove, l list.

`?' and `C-h' belong to transient's own help, so status is on `s'.
Worktrees are on `%' and the raw-method escape hatch on `:', matching
where magit puts the same two ideas."
