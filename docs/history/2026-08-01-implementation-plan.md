# herdr.el Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** An Emacs package that controls herdr over its unix-socket JSON API, hosts herdr terminals inside Emacs via ghostel, and surfaces agent status through a transient menu, a modeline segment, and a status buffer.

**Architecture:** Two independent socket channels to the herdr server — one-shot connections for RPC (the server closes after each response) and long-lived connections for event subscriptions. A snapshot cache hydrated by `session.snapshot` and mutated by events is the single source of truth for all UI. Terminal hosting is an interface with two implementations, `session` and `agent-windows`.

**Tech Stack:** Emacs Lisp (28.1+), `transient`, `ghostel`, ERT. Soft deps: `magit-section`, `marginalia`, `embark`, `consult`, `alert`.

## Global Constraints

- Emacs 28.1+. No hard dependency beyond `transient` and `ghostel`.
- herdr protocol 17. Warn on mismatch, never refuse to run.
- Socket default `~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`.
- **RPC is one request per connection.** The server writes one response then closes. Never reuse a connection for a second request.
- **`events.subscribe` is the only long-lived call.** It acks `{"result":{"type":"subscription_started"}}` then streams.
- **Per-pane `pane.agent_status_changed` subscriptions are required** for agent status. Global `pane_updated` coalesces and misses transitions (measured: 1 event for 3 changes).
- All JSON parsed with `:object-type 'alist :array-type 'list :null-object nil :false-object nil`.
- Every file gets a lexical-binding cookie and standard package headers.
- Commit after every task. No backticks in commit messages.

## Spike results (already measured, do not re-litigate)

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| VT throughput | Non-issue. 14 MB pane dump reaches Emacs as 17 KB (session) / 24 KB (attach) in 0.2s. herdr coalesces ~500-700x. |
| Second session client | Coexists. No takeover needed. |
| `pane_updated` carries status? | **No.** Per-pane subscriptions required. |
| OSC 7 / OSC 133 through herdr? | **Yes**, both forwarded to an attach client. |
| `agent attach` on a plain shell pane | Refused, unless `pane.report_agent` is called first, which makes it attachable. |
| Attach needs a PTY winsize | **Yes.** With a 0x0 winsize the client paints nothing. ghostel supplies one. |

### Task 1: RPC transport

**Files:** Create `herdr-rpc.el`, `test/herdr-rpc-test.el`, `Makefile`, `.gitignore`

**Interfaces produced:**
- `(herdr-rpc-call METHOD &optional PARAMS)` → result alist; signals `herdr-error`
- `(herdr-rpc-call-async METHOD PARAMS CALLBACK)` → process; CALLBACK gets `(RESULT ERR)`
- `(herdr-rpc-connect NAME FILTER SENTINEL)` → process, for long-lived callers
- `(herdr-rpc-encode ID METHOD PARAMS)` → JSON string with trailing newline
- `herdr-socket-path`, `herdr-executable` defcustoms
- `herdr-error` condition, `(herdr-error-code ERR)`

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write `test/herdr-rpc-test.el` with a fake-server fixture: `make-network-process :server t :family 'local :service <temp>` whose filter writes a canned line then deletes the client process (producing EOF). Tests: successful call returns parsed alist; error response signals `herdr-error` with code; empty params serialize as `{}` not `null`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `make test`. Expect failure — file does not exist.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implement `herdr-rpc.el`.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `make test`. Expect pass.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Commit.

### Task 2: Schema loading

**Files:** Create `herdr-schema.el`, `test/herdr-schema-test.el`

**Interfaces produced:**
- `(herdr-schema)` → cached schema alist, loaded from `herdr api schema --json`
- `(herdr-schema-methods)` → list of method-name strings
- `(herdr-schema-params METHOD)` → alist of `(NAME . PROPERTY-SCHEMA)`
- `(herdr-schema-required METHOD)` → list of required param name strings
- `(herdr-schema-read-param METHOD NAME)` → value read from the user per its schema type
- `herdr-schema-cache-file` defcustom

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write tests against `test/fixtures/schema-protocol-17.json`: 89 methods; `pane.read` requires `pane_id` and `source`; `ReadSource` `$ref` resolves to its four-value enum.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run, expect fail. **Step 3:** Implement. **Step 4:** Run, expect pass. **Step 5:** Commit.

### Task 3: State reducer (pure)

**Files:** Create `herdr-state.el`, `test/herdr-state-test.el`

**Interfaces produced:**
- `(herdr-state-empty)` → fresh state
- `(herdr-state-from-snapshot SNAPSHOT)` → state
- `(herdr-state-reduce STATE EVENT-KIND DATA)` → new state (pure, no I/O)
- `(herdr-state-panes STATE)`, `-workspaces`, `-tabs`, `-agents`, `(herdr-state-pane STATE ID)`
- `(herdr-state-focused-pane-id STATE)`

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write tests: `pane_created` adds; `pane_closed` removes; `pane_updated` replaces by id; `pane_agent_status_changed` updates only `agent_status`; `pane_focused` moves focus; unknown event kind is a no-op returning an equal state.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run, expect fail. **Step 3:** Implement. **Step 4:** Run, expect pass. **Step 5:** Commit.

### Task 4: Live state — connections and subscriptions

**Files:** Modify `herdr-state.el`; create `test/herdr-state-live-test.el`

**Interfaces produced:**
- `(herdr-state-start)` / `(herdr-state-stop)`
- `(herdr-state-current)` → current state
- `herdr-state-change-hook` — abnormal hook, called with `(EVENT-KIND DATA)`
- `(herdr-state-resync)` → refetch snapshot, rebuild per-pane subscriptions

Two connections. **A**: global subscriptions, never rebuilt. **B**: per-pane `pane.agent_status_changed` for every pane in the cache, torn down and re-subscribed whenever the pane set changes, each rebuild followed by a snapshot-based status refresh. Reconnect with backoff 1s→30s, then full resync.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write tests using the fake server: `subscription_started` ack is not dispatched as an event; two NDJSON events in one TCP chunk both dispatch; a partial line buffers until its newline arrives; EOF schedules a reconnect.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run, expect fail. **Step 3:** Implement. **Step 4:** Run, expect pass. **Step 5:** Commit.

### Task 5: Terminal backends and entry point

**Files:** Create `herdr-term.el`, `herdr.el`; create `test/herdr-term-test.el`

**Interfaces produced:**
- `herdr-terminal-backend` defcustom — `session` (default) or `agent-windows`
- `(herdr-term-ensure)` / `(herdr-term-teardown)` / `(herdr-term-buffer-for-pane PANE-ID)` / `(herdr-term-display)`
- `(herdr-term-reconcile STATE BUFFERS)` → `(TO-CREATE . TO-REAP)`, pure
- `(herdr)` — interactive autoloaded entry point
- `herdr-display-action` defcustom

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write tests for `herdr-term-reconcile` as a pure function: agent in state with no buffer → create; buffer with no matching pane → reap; non-agent pane → neither. No ghostel, no server.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run, expect fail. **Step 3:** Implement both backends. `agent-windows` runs `herdr agent attach <pane-id>` per agent, driven by `pane_agent_detected` / `pane_closed`, prompting before `--takeover`. **Step 4:** Run, expect pass. **Step 5:** Commit.

### Task 6: Curated commands

**Files:** Create `herdr-cmd.el`, `test/herdr-cmd-test.el`

~27 wrappers over pane, tab, workspace, worktree, agent, and session methods, each defaulting `pane_id` to `(herdr-state-focused-pane-id)`. Includes `herdr-pane-read` (into a buffer, `ansi-color-apply-on-region` when `format` is `ansi`), `herdr-pane-run` (`pane.send_text` plus newline, since the CLI's `pane run` has no API method), `herdr-agent-wait` and `herdr-pane-wait-for-output` (both async).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write tests: every command in `herdr-cmd-methods` names a method present in the fixture schema, and passes only params that schema declares. **Step 2:** Run, expect fail. **Step 3:** Implement. **Step 4:** Run, expect pass. **Step 5:** Commit.

### Task 7: Selection UI

**Files:** Create `herdr-select.el`, `test/herdr-select-test.el`

- `(herdr-select-pane &optional PROMPT)`, `-agent`, `-workspace`, `-tab`
- `(herdr-select--annotate-pane CANDIDATE)` → annotation string
- Embark keymap on category `herdr-pane`; consult source appended to `consult-buffer-sources` only when consult is loaded.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write tests for the annotator as a pure function over a state fixture. **Step 2:** Run, expect fail. **Step 3:** Implement. **Step 4:** Run, expect pass. **Step 5:** Commit.

### Task 8: Transient

**Files:** Create `herdr-transient.el`

Root prefix showing the scoped pane in its header, with `p`/`t`/`w`/`W`/`a` sub-prefixes and `x` for `herdr-call`, matching the layout in the spec.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Implement. **Step 2:** Byte-compile clean under `make compile`. **Step 3:** Commit.

### Task 9: Agents buffer, modeline, notifications

**Files:** Create `herdr-agents.el`, `test/herdr-agents-test.el`

- `(herdr-agents)` — `*herdr-agents*`, `magit-section` tree when available, plain text otherwise
- `(herdr-agents--segment STATE)` → modeline string, pure
- `herdr-notify-statuses` defcustom, default `nil`

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write tests for `herdr-agents--segment` over state fixtures: two blocked and one done → `herdr:2⏸1✓`; no agents → empty string. **Step 2:** Run, expect fail. **Step 3:** Implement. **Step 4:** Run, expect pass. **Step 5:** Commit.

### Task 10: Escape hatch and drift test

**Files:** Create `herdr-call.el`, `test/herdr-drift-test.el`

- `(herdr-call METHOD)` — interactive, completes over all 89 methods, prompts each param from its schema.
- Drift test, tagged `:live`, skipped when no server: every method named in `herdr-cmd-methods` exists in the live schema.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write both. **Step 2:** Run `make test` and `make test-live`. **Step 3:** Commit.

### Task 11: Packaging

**Files:** Create `README.md`, `LICENSE`; modify all files for headers and autoload cookies.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Write README covering install, both backends, and the `report_agent` note. **Step 2:** `make compile` clean, `make test` green. **Step 3:** Commit.

## Self-review notes

- Spec's `pane_updated`-carries-status open question is resolved by the spike table and Task 4's two-connection design.
- Spec's "~27 curated commands" is Task 6; the drift test that keeps them honest is Task 10.
- Spec's backend reconciliation test is Task 5 Step 1.
- Shells-in-herdr remains out of scope per the spec, but spike 4 undermines both of its stated objections. Flag at review; do not expand scope unilaterally.
